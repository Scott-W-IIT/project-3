    <h3 class="h3plies">Of Executive Respect</h3>
    <p class="h3plies">Geoff, the General Corporate Manager of Jimmy John’s Sandwich Company, once came to the downtown Iowa City store and asked if I was still the quickest. “Duh.” I replied and motioned towards the blue road bike outside the door. Made mostly of spare parts and hand-me-downs, my delivery bicycle, Panasonic Rex, is the most beautiful, most lightening-like, and most worthy in the Jimmy John’s fleet. He assigned me a sixty-four dollar(!) delivery, which I completed so fast that the sandwich recipients tore their hair out from the roots. Thus qualifying Jimmy John’s motto: “So fast you’ll freak.”</p>
    <h3 class="h3plies">Of Shortcomings and Rivalries</h3>
    <p class="h3plies">I was once stiffed on a delivery to a far away dorm. As the miser was walking away, smirking with the greedy wrinkle of an ill-considered-penny, poorly pinched, at the bulge of his hip pocket, I pushed hard on a pedal while holding the front brake, kicking dirt onto the back of his Hawkeye jersey. From that point on he was referred to as “Dirty Bird” and eventually dropped out of college as a result of the shame. He now works at Subway. Gross.</p>
    <p class="h3plies">Panasonic Rex has a single flaw: Just before reaching supersonic speeds, it is known to shake quite violently. Something to do with bicycle aerodynamics. But once past the sonic boom, it rides as soft as a teddy bear skiing down a marshmallow mountain on a sunny day at one of the less-snooty resorts that also has a hot tub. </p>
    <h3 class="h3plies">Of Beauty and Strength</h3>
    <p class="h3plies">Many have asked me if it is hard, given my physical condition and the state of my bike, to keep the pretty young-things away. I cannot lie, I am man and have my temptations: the slender, smooth, muscular tubing of Panasonic Rex’s frame, however, keeps me focused. </p>
    <h3 class="h3plies">Of Remarkable Performance</h3>
    <p class="h3plies">During a game night, Panasonic Rex and I passed a gaggle of young-things on their way to the bars. The wind Panasonic Rex produced was such that as we passed, it blew all their clothes off. I made my delivery and – to avoid scandal – returned the same way, blowing their clothes back on. </p>
    <p class="h3plies">Taking up two spots while pulling up to Jimmy John’s in a gold-flecked Cadillac SUV, a certain famous automobile-a-phile (whose name I’ve omitted in case he runs for office) offered Panasonic Rex and me the chance to be his sub at a NASCAR race. “Sub? As in substitute?” I rolled my eyes up so only the whites showed, then kept rolling… all the way back, yup, and then up again. I completed the first three-hundred-sixty-degree complete eye-roll, arms crossed. “Dismissed.” At the Daytona 500 some days later, still distraught by the rebuff, he mistakenly turned right – a big no-no in NASCAR racing. The upshot is that after the hospital released him I hear he got into cycling, supports his local farmer’s market, and even drives a hybrid.</p>
    <h3 class="h3plies">Of Meeting</h3>
    <p class="h3plies">Some of this is legend, but at least this much is fact: when peasant looters sacked The Magnificent Gilbert St. Parking Ramp in the aftermath of some football game, they found a hidden elevator that led to a secret chamber. Within that chamber they spied a bike rack – the first bike rack, in fact – made by the swinging hammer of Hephaestus himself – if we are to believe the archeologists and theologians who came later. None of those looters survived to tell their tale, the sacred room was obviously booby-trapped, but believing they stumbled upon something great, I deduced what happened in their final moments by following their footsteps (I was unemployed at the time and loitering in the area). Amongst the many forgotten treasures piled high within that space I discovered Panasonic Rex. We rode out together in a burst of flame and ruble; birds sang out and fire hydrants erupted in glorious fountains. Geoff, watching from the shop across the street, offered me a job on the spot.</p>
